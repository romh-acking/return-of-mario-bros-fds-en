# Return of Mario Bros.: English Translation

## About

This is another translation for Kaettekita Mario Brothers for the Famicom Disk System.

## Manual
Check out the repo [return-of-mario-bros-fds-en-manual](https://github.com/romh-acking/return-of-mario-bros-fds-en-manual) for manual resources. It contains the original scans, a blanked version, and a typeset version.

Huge thanks to Sho from [Gaming Alexandria](https://www.patreon.com/gamingalexandria) for providing a manual scan for this game. It wasn't uploaded to the site as he said it didn't quite meet the site's quality standards (which, to be fair, is a very high bar).

## Instructions
The tools are coded in C#. You'll have to mess with Wine if you want them to run in Linux. You'll also have to rewrite the bat files, which aren't complicated at all.

You'll need a dump of the game titled `Kaettekita Mario Brothers (Japan) (Disk Writer).fds` in the rom folder (I realize the correct term is "disk image" for FDS games, but alas).

* If you want to dump the script for whatever reason (the Japanese and English script are already included in this repository), you can dump it by executing the bat file "Dump.bat" by double clicking it. 
* To compile the translation, execute the bat file "Dump.bat" by double clicking it.

## Changelog
* 1.0:
	* Initial release
